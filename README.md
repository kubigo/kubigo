This project is a web-based dashboard for managing Kubernetes clusters. It provides a user-friendly interface for viewing and managing Kubernetes resources across multiple clusters.
Additionally, the dashboard now includes deployment history and rollback features, allowing users to track changes to their deployments and easily revert to previous versions if needed.

## Key Features ðŸŒŸ

- **Multi-Cluster Support:** Add, select, and manage multiple Kubernetes clusters with support for ServiceAccountToken, ClientCertificate, Azure, and KubeConfig authentication.
- **Namespace Isolation:** All resource actions are namespace-aware and scoped.
- **Resource CRUD:** Create, view, edit (YAML and forms), and delete for Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Pods, Jobs, CronJobs, Services, Ingresses, ConfigMaps, Secrets, PersistentVolumes, PersistentVolumeClaims, Nodes, Namespaces, and Custom Resources (CRDs).
- **Direct Single Resource Fetch:** Efficient API endpoints and UI logic to fetch individual resource details (reduces frontend load).
- **YAML Editing & Viewing:** Edit and apply YAML for resources, with syntax highlighting and validation.
- **Resource Rollout/Rollback:** Dedicated endpoints and UI for deployment rollout history and safe rollback operations.
- **Resource Metrics:** Pod and Node metrics (CPU, memory, etc.) with backend support for metrics endpoints.
- **KEDA Autoscaling:** View and manage KEDA ScaledObjects, including pause/resume and YAML editing.
- **Helm Chart Management:** View Helm releases and charts (if enabled).
